React --> 

What is React? --> JS Library (Benefit of Library) --> Code that i write in Js to develop project it requires  more line,  same thing  we do in React  less line.

Optimization provide, Netflix,FB,Instagram and zomato are built with help of React. Work we do with the help of react same work we also do with the help of Js.

Like in C++ we have array we can perform operation but it is static to solve that problem we have  
Vector to easy our work.(STL Library basically do our easy)

Why we need it ? , 


Create our own React? --> Not write code on React 

Handling all the use case , or we can use it that is already written by FB developer that is optimized and used by many company.
(By handling all the cases we can create our own library)


React is Js we can work in short by structure our code.
