Before we use class components in React but now it is deprecated or no-one use it. 

Hooks --> Functional components (Introduce in new React version ) To do our work easily, easy to write.

React main use case is State Management like to maintain previous state, current state, next state.

Example of Instagram --> In which someone msg you or like your post there state will be change. So we have to display it without re-redering the page that is handle and optimize by React.

In Js (counter project) --> Is the example of State Management in which you directly interact with DOM.

But in the couter program of React you bypass the react that's why not show on the UI.

We have to use it useState
You interact with --->   React(Mediator)   ----> Change In UI 

example of translator who translate the one lang to another lang.
