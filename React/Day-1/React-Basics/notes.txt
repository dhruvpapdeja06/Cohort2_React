React --> 

What is React? --> JS Library (Benefit of Library) --> To develop the project in Js we have to write more lines of code, same thing we do with the help of React(less lines).

Optimization provide, Netflix,FB,Instagram and zomato are built with help of React. 

The work we do with the help of react same work we also do with the help of Js.

Like in C++ we have array we can perform operation on it and it's nature is static.
To solve that problem we have Vector(dynamic in nature) easily perform opertation.(STL Library(easy our work)

Why we need React --> To optimize the code ,appication load fast ,interactive UI   
Create our own React? --> Not write code on React (Creating our Own React Library (Approcah) 

Handling all the use case , or we can use it that is already written by FB developer that is optimized and used by many company.

React provide folder structure with the help of bundler to optimize it.
